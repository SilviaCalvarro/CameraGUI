# CameraGUI
I have done a Graphical User Interface for a Thermal Camera. I programmed it on C++ and I used the software Qt. The structure of this project is made up of 3 threads that each one has a specific porpuse.

MainWindow thread controls all actions related to buttons on the GUI.
ImageConfiguration thread realizes changes to the captured image for the porpuse of improving it.
VideoCapture thread is responsible for maintaining the possibility of image acquisition.

Hereunder I add some images of GUI's shape:
